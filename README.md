# DASF is an Accelerated and Scalable Framework

DASF is a generic framework specialized in acceleration and scaling common 
techniques for Machine Learning. DASF uses most methods and function from 
the most common libraries to increase the speed up of most algorithms. Part 
of this is to use Dask data to scale computation and RAPIDS AI algorithms to 
extend the support to GPUs as well.
